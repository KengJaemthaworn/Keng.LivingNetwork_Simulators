# Keng.LivingNetwork_Simulators
Fun simulator for small world network theory 

Here you can change the parameter 
- Network size (node/degree)
- Randomness

You can simulate
- Network structures
- Input signal and its propagate
  
You can observe 
- Topological change:
  C: clustering Coefficient (Global)
  L: Characteristic Path Length
- Step of propagate from 1st node till all nodes
